# Medical AI Project

## Overview
This project aims to build a scalable, modular, and high-performance AI system for medical diagnosis. Leveraging state-of-the-art technologies like Natural Language Processing (NLP), Computer Vision (CV), and advanced machine learning techniques, this system is designed to assist healthcare professionals by providing accurate and interpretable diagnostics.

The goal is to achieve an 80% diagnosis accuracy with the ability to process both textual and imaging data, ensuring the system’s usability in real-world clinical environments.

## Features
- **NLP Module**:
  - Processes medical records, symptoms, and patient history.
  - Extracts relevant information and provides insights using models like BERT and GPT.

- **CV Module**:
  - Analyzes medical images such as X-rays, MRIs, and CT scans.
  - Utilizes CNN architectures (e.g., ResNet, EfficientNet) for high-accuracy image classification.

- **Diagnosis Module**:
  - Combines results from the NLP and CV modules to generate a final diagnostic prediction.
  - Provides interpretable results for medical professionals.

- **API Layer**:
  - REST API for seamless integration with web, mobile, and clinical systems.

- **Modular Architecture**:
  - Clean, maintainable, and scalable design following Clean Architecture principles.

- **Compliance**:
  - GDPR and HIPAA-compliant data processing.
